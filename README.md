# Fluid Sim

Fluid Sim is a *hopefully* lifelike, real-time fluid simulator built on OpenGL and Cuda.

# How To Run

Download the ```.exe``` file from latest [Release]([url](https://github.com/philippesic/fluisism/releases/tag/Alpha)) and run it.
Control the camera with your mouse.

Future Updates will include:
* Increased and adjustable particle density
* Adjustable fluid properties
* Expanded Camera Controls
* Improved Graphics
* Improved Physics
* Improved Performance

```Due to performance issues, the particle density is currently hard-set to 1024, which should run well on most modern CPUs.```

# Requirements

* A GPU with Cuda Support
